#### _Translates a string into pig latin, 1.20.2016_

#### By _**Joseph Karasek and Austin Minnon**_

## Description

_This site will eventually prompt the user for a string and translate that string into Pig Latin, an ancient and mysterious language. The goal of this project is to practice BDD with javascript using the Mocha framework and Chai assertion library._

_Current version does not include a front end for a user to enter a string to translate. Specs show the functionality that has been built out already. The program can handle clean english sentences with no special characters outside of the center of words. Detects spaces and periods. Can handle multiple sentences._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_Clone this repository and open index.html in any standard browser. You may also check out the specs at specs/spec-runner.html._

## Known Bugs

_No known bugs at this time. This program was not tested for a wide range of possible inputs including special characters, numbers, etc. However, does work with clean sentences._

## Support and contact details

_Feel free to contact the authors of this project through GitHub._

## Technologies Used

_jQuery, Bootstrap, Mocha, Chai_
